Project 2 Sim City Expanded

This project is for CSCE 2110

Description: This program will demonstrate the development of a city. There will be residential, pollution, industrial and commercial zones. As the city populates, these factors will be expanded. 
- The program utilizes a grid to display the growth of the city
- The city will have roads and powerline
- Besides the major functionalities of residential, pollution, industrial, and commercial, additional factors include trees, natural disasters, hospitals, schools, and diverse housing types.

Purpose: This project not only strengthens the coding environment for teamwork, but it also reinforces the logistics of city building and the possible spread of pollution, which is a big global concern.
